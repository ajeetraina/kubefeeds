# The Kubernetes Knowledge Hub

KubeFeeds is an automated content platform dedicated to Kubernetes enthusiasts, practitioners, and learners. We deliver regular, high-quality content covering the entire Kubernetes ecosystem through a combination of AI-generated articles and real-time news curation.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make Kubernetes knowledge accessible, practical, and consistently available to the community by:

- Providing regular updates on important Kubernetes topics
- Gathering and curating the latest news from authoritative sources
- Tracking releases of Kubernetes and ecosystem tools
- Creating structured, informative content with practical examples
- Highlighting active discussions and development in the community

## How It Works

KubeFeeds employs a sophisticated automated publishing pipeline:

### Automated Content Generation

Our system selects relevant Kubernetes topics and creates detailed, structured content with practical examples. The content is generated based on a database of Kubernetes topics, from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

### Real-time News Fetching

We automatically collect the latest news, blog posts, and updates from official Kubernetes sources, cloud providers, and community contributors. This content is fetched from authoritative sources in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### GitHub Release Tracking

The system monitors new releases of Kubernetes and popular ecosystem tools, keeping you informed of the latest versions and their features.
